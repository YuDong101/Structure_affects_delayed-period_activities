# Structure_affects_delayed-period_activities

This repository is part of the paper: Maintenance of delay-period activity in working memory task is modulated by local network structure, by: Dong Yu, T. Li, Q. Ding, Y. Wu, Z. Fu, X. Zhan, L. Yang, and Ya Jia.

#########

The code is implemented in Matlab language. To study the relationship between local neural activity and local topological structure.

Please note that for figure3-8, it takes more than 1 day to run. Please run 'main' function in subfolder 'Run_out_data' to get the data with suffix .mat, then use the 'analyzy' function in subfolder 'data_analysis ' in the subfolder 'data_analysis' to get the correlation between duration and topology.
